# 🧸 MikuDachi — Tamagotchi-Inspired Flutter Game

**Miku Dachi** is a virtual pet game inspired by the classic **Tamagotchi** (or *Bichinho Virtual*, as we call it in Brazil).
It was developed entirely using **Flutter and Dart**, without any external game engines, as a **personal study project**.

The goal was to explore Flutter's capabilities for interactive, game-like UI and state management.

### 🎮 Features:

* Feed, play, and care for your virtual companion
* Pixel-art inspired UI with nostalgic vibes
* Built with custom logic using only Flutter widgets
* Lightweight and mobile-friendly

### 🚧 Project Status:

This is a **study project**, and while I plan to release small updates to add basic features, I don’t intend to expand it into a full game.

> ❗ *I couldn't find the original artist for the Miku character used. If you know the source, please let me know so I can credit them properly!*
